# SBA-320
1. Explanation of the project:

This project generates a random name from the click of a button using limited list of characters from the Rick and Morty api (a link of which will be provided).

The goal was to get a basic react app up and running while also having a live deployed version of it.

2. Explanations of the technologies used:

The technologies used in this project were react with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the two dependencies added to make this project work were react-dom, and react-router-dom in order to get link interactivity between pages

This entire project was made using VS code on windows 10 and will be deployed using Netlify for which a link will be provided to the deployed project

3. Usage instructions:

Using the app is relatively simple, there is a button that the user can click to generate a character name from the show Rick and Morty. The user can even click on the name that will redirect them to the second page of the site. The second page also has button that redirects the user back to the main page so that they can go back to generating random character names

4. Ideas yet to be implemented:

An evolution for this project in particular would be when the character name gets clicked it would bring the user to the secondary page displaying information of the character they clicked on. Another addition would be to increase the amount of characters that the button is able to go through.
